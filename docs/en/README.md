Secondary, you may have been facing with the judgement - for studying or for playing. As for this subject, you have ability to acknowledge the cutting-edge technology news or catch up with whatever you like, it depends on yourself! 

Thirdly, when it comes to the English ability, yeah I know most of students(includes me, even this article has grammatical errors) have trouble learning or using this language. However, it is necessary to master itself since there are tons of references or courses that using or speaking in English but you have to learn. Thus, improve yourself and to be a better student!
