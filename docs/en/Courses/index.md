# Courses
The outline courses learned from software development is difficulty for the student to hand on, and for sometimes, some courses they could learn few of things. Thus, I would like to recommend for you to improve better understanding or add some as common sense. 

In addition, you can search and find all the courses from BiliBili or YouTube platform, and the former platform will have the Chinese title to understand.

And another point of things, the courses usually provided the assignments and project to practice. ***DO NOT IGNORE THAT!!!*** Though you could watch the video with taking some notes, ***practice makes perfect***.

## First-year Entry
As for the first-year entry student, you would like to have the basic courses like language and mathematics 

***After supply***

---
## Second-year Entry
As for he second-year entry student or called the freshman(three years graduation in UK), you would start to learn the professional courses related to the subject. Some courses are easy to follow with and seldom university to hold up, thus I just recommend the curial courses to have. 
### CS61A
>This is the course from Berklee where the profession will teach you how to learn the program in Python language(This is regraded as the basic language for most of college) .

CS61A is the **beginning** of all the courses for the BCL student, where it is identical to the [Developing Software Introduction-HP1R_47](https://cn.sqa.org.uk/files/SQA-Advanced/Computing_Software_Development/Computing_Software_Units/HP1R47.pdf) course. However, the differences between them is that:
1. SQA class is learned by C++ while CS61A is learned by Python, which is easier than the former one.
2. SQA class is learned about only introduction, while CS61A could brings you lots of knowledge that will learn latter like Object-oriented, trees and so on.

Thus I would highly recommend you to learn where you will acknowledge how a program is constructed with. Although there are various knowledge we have not learn and discrepancy between language, you can just learn the fundamental.

*comment: It is best for when learning the SQA courses or before*
### CS50
>This is the courses from Harford where it will mention some basic knowledge like logical numbers and etc. 

I would like to choose whatever you like to watch and don't have to learn all because of the video length and the speed and text difficulty. Thus, I would likely to let you learn as the supplement sources, where why the computer use the number 0 and 1, and how to use them to explain different meanings...

*comment: if you have spare time to watch*
### Missing Semester
>This the special courses from MIT where as you see, the courses called *Missing Semester*, is used to compensate for the fundamental knowledge, you have to know but no one tell you

I would **highly recommend** you to learn this courses, especially Linux command, vim, docker and so on. Because these knowledge are impossible to study from the domestic 
courses. And with the further deep study , you will surprisingly found that some knowledge you have had learnt it **whenever you watch this video**!  

However, just like the course title - "Missing Semester", it only focuses on the missing knowledge, which means they are not in system order grouped. So it is very difficult to learn and master rather than understanding.

I have selected some classes that may benefit to you, and you could learn these with I given order(not follow the courses order):
1. Course overview + the shell
2. Editors (Vim)
3. Version Control (Git)
4. Shell Tools and Scripting ( have to learn the shell before this course)
5. Command-line Environment (author still learning)
6. ~~Debugging and Profiling~~(author haven't learnt, but seems vey useful in the later XD)

*comment: Although I say it is importance, some knowledge i may would not use more than once. Remember, benefit for yourself！*

### CS70

This is the discrete math class from the Berklee that may be identical to the [Mathematics for Computing 1-HP1H 47](https://cn.sqa.org.uk/files/SQA-Advanced/Computing_Software_Development/Computing_Software_Units/HP1H47.pdf). But the domestic courses are very week with poor outcome testing. So you could learn it systematically from this class

However, I have not finished learning this class, so i couldn't explain any benefits for you. However, you could learn this courses:

### UESTC-Discrete Math
> the courses name is refined by myself because of it is unofficial courses

To be honest,

Here are the challenging courses to learn with, after thinking twice, I put them into the Third-year Entry courses, but you could click to jump to the section.

* [CMU 15-445]
# Third-year Entry
As you steps into the third year, the difficulty of SQA courses have gradually increased. And you may have no spare time or stamina to learn(As for me). In despite of this, the study is no better than lifestyle.

### CMU 15-445
> very very hard to learn, although it is should be learned in the Second year

This is the courses from the household university CMU, where you will learn the database knowledge
